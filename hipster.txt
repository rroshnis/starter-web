A school is a division of the school system consisting of students comprising one or more grade groups or other identifiable groups, organized as one unit with one or more teachers to give instruction of a defined type and housed in one or more buildings. More than one school may be housed in one building or compound, as is the case when elementary and secondary schools are housed in the same building or compound.  
Refers to the unique role that it plays in comparison to other organizations. It has both organization and community attributes. The role of the organization implies that the school has official leaders, such as school principals and department heads, who are in charge of the school's daily operations. The role of the community is concerned with learning, education, and research, and they have informal (even dynamic) leaders, such as teachers and lecturers who specialise in certain areas and share knowledge with other stakeholders, such as students, experts, and various roles useful for researching. The school members may have two identities at the same time: leaders and followers. This is the end of this document.
