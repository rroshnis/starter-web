A school is a division of the school system consisting of students comprising one or more grade groups or other identifiable groups, organized as one unit with one or more teachers to give instruction of a defined type and housed in one or more buildings.

Refers to the unique role that it plays in comparison to other organizations. It has both organization and community attributes. The role of the organization implies that the school has official leaders, such as school principals and department heads, who are in charge of the school's daily operations. The role of the community is concerned with learning, education, and research, and they have informal (even dynamic) leaders, such as teachers and lecturers who specialise in certain areas and share knowledge with other stakeholders, such as students, experts, and various roles useful for researching. The school members may have two identities at the same time: leaders and followers.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
